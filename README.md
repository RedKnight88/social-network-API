## Description
This project is a server-side application for use in a social media site / application. Emulating the databases and frameworks for some of the most successful technological endeavors of our generation allowed me insight into how our modern media landscape is structured. Websites I use every day organize themselves in a similar fashion (albeit, at a much larger scale), so it was fun to practice thinking through the problems that even cutting edge programmers will face. This also utilized a few modern technologies in MongoDB and Mongoose, its ODM, to create models that interact with ExpressJS, all housed in Node. One step away from the MERN stack!

## Installation
Download this repositroy through GitHub. Other required installations: NodeJS, and MongoDB.

## Usage
After installing the necessary packages with NodeJS (use the command 'npm i' once inside the folder with the server.js file), as well as preparing the MongoDB instance on your computer, seed the data by running 'node seeds/index.js' and then 'node server.js' to start the server. Utilizing either your browser or a third-party application such as insomnia, you can access the routes of the API to interact with the database.
